name: map
type: function
summary: >-
  Calls _function_ with each product from _iterable_.

  `map` is suitable for use with both synchronous iterables and asynchronous iterables, and will return a generator producing the resulting products with matching synchronicity.

  `map` uses Array::map when specifically passed an array, so in that case it returns a new array.
