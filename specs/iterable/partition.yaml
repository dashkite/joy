  Returns the products of an _iterable_ unchanged, but grouped into partitions. Each partition is an array with a length of at least 1 and at most _size_.
description: |-
  Returns the products of an _iterable_ unchanged, but grouped into partitions. Each partition is an array with a length of at least 1 and at most _size_.

  `partition` produces these partitions until the _iterable_ is exhausted, at which point the final partition may have some length less than _size_, but it will never be empty.

  `partition` is suitable for both synchronous iterators and asynchronous iterators. `partition` returns a generator with synchronicity matching _iterable_. In both cases, the resultant products are arrays of the underlying products.

signatures:
  - arguments:
      - name: size
        type: Number
        description: The maximum length of the arrays that make up each partition of products.
      - name: iterable
        type: Iterable
        description: The iterable from which to consume products.
    returns:
      name: generator
      type: Generator
      description: Produces arrays of length _size_, listing otherwise unaltered products from the source _iterable_.
