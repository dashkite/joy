  Returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either
  resolved or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome
  of each promise. Effectively maps an iterable of promises to an array of
  results.

  For each outcome object, a status string is present. If the status is
  fulfilled, then a value is present. If the status is rejected, then a reason
  is present. The value (or reason) reflects what value each promise was
  fulfilled (or rejected) with.
