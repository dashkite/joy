summary: >-
  Defines getters on _target_ using the given _dictionary_ of keys and getter
  functions. Convenience wrapper for [`getter`](#getter). Like most Joy
  functions, `getters` is curryable, so you can define a function that will
  define a property on any object. Use in combination with [`mixin`](#mixin) to
  create reusable mixins.

          ]
        assert.equal "bar", (new Foo).bar
