title: arity
name: arity
type: function
summary: Returns an n-ary function that passes its arguments to a target function.
signatures:
  - arguments:
      - name: desiredArity
        type: Number
        description: The desired arity of the returned `wrapper`. Must be an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive.
      - name: target
        type: Function
        description: The target function to be wrapped. The returned `wrapper` wraps `target` and passes its arguments to `target`.
    returns:
      name: wrapper
      type: Function
      description: An anonymous function with the desired arity. This function wraps `target` and passes it all arguments.

  A function's [arity][] describes how many arguments it expects. Joy provides `arity` as a means to manipulate arity, an operation that is a fundamental building block of functional composition. Rather than modifying `target` directly, `arity` shims the interface with one that has the desired arity.

  `arity` wraps `target` with an anonymous function, `wrapper`. `wrapper` has an arity of `desiredArity` However, `arity` prioritizes pragmatism. `wrapper` passes the [`arguments`][] object to `target`. So, _all_ arguments passed to `wrapper` are passed to `target`, regardless of `desiredArity`.

  `arity` also ensures `target` runs with the current [`this`][].

  !!! Primary Point of Interest
  JavaScript is somewhat lenient regarding arity. When you invoke a function, it takes a YOLO approach, running with whatever arguments are available. Strictly speaking, that's a little reckless, but it's powerful when used responsibly. `arity` preserves that flexibilty inherent to the language.

  The [`Function`][] object provides [`Function.length`][], letting us ask a function to describe its arity. That reflective interface assists us when we build metaprogramming structures, including functional composition.

example:
  sections:
    - title: We may freely establish arity.
      code:
        CoffeeScript: |-
          f = ->
          g = _.arity 4, f

          assert.equal 0,
            f.length

          assert.equal 4,
            g.length
        JavaScript: |-
          let f = function(){};
          let g = _.arity(4, f);

          assert.equal(0,
            f.length);

          assert.equal(4,
            g.length);

      description: |-
        We may freely establish an interface of a given arity for our function. However, note that the underlying function, `f`, remains unchanged. We are shimming the interface. We are wrapping `f` with a function that:

        1. Has an interface that matches our specification
        2. Transparently passes the arguments along.

    - title: "`arity` does not provide enforcement."
      code:
        CoffeeScript: |-
          double = (x) -> x * 2
          nullaryDouble = _.arity 0, double

          assert.equal 0,
            nullaryDouble.length

          assert.equal 4,
            nullaryDouble 2
        JavaScript: |-
          let double = (x) => x * 2;
          let nullaryDouble = _.arity(0, double);

          assert.equal(0,
            nullaryDouble.length);

          assert.equal(4,
            nullaryDouble(2));

      description: |
        We can look at the arity of `nullaryDouble` and confirm that it is `0` (nullary). However, `arity` does not provide enforcemet. We can pass an argument to `nullaryDouble`. It accepts the argument and returns its double.

        This example highlights the pragmatism of `arity`. The function `nullaryDouble` does present a nullary interface, but it will also pass along any arguments it receives (via the [`arguments`][] object). If you're buliding a structure that depends on strict arity enforcement, you're free to inspect `Function.length` and opt into that rigor, but that's not `arity`'s design goal.

    - title: Use `arity` to build interfaces with intention.
      code:
        CoffeeScript: |-
          wait = (f) ->
            _.arity f.length, (ax...) ->
              Promise.all ax
                .then (ax) -> f ax...
        JavaScript: |-
          const wait = (f) => {
            return _.arity(f.length, (...ax) => {
              return Promise.all(ax)
                .then(ax => f(...ax));
            });
          };

      description: |
        For this example, let's take a look at the implementation of [`wait`][].

        In summary, imagine having several arguments to pass to `f`, but some of them are promises. We would like to make sure they all resolve before we pass them to `f`.

        We could write that imperatively, but Joy encourages a functional style. That involves building up interfaces that do what we need. And in this case, `wait` is an interface shim that resolves those promises for us.

        But when we sat down to write `wait`, we wanted it to be as flexible as possible and to not obscure the interface it's shimming. `wait` inspects the underlying function and uses `arity` to _preserve_ its arity.

        That allows `wait` to be powerful and flexible. And because it preserves the arity, we give ourselves the optionality to use that in another, higher-level interface.

        Being intentional about interface optionality is a hallmark of functional composition. It's a design decision in Joy to encourage it, and it reflects the pragmatism of JavaScript itself. Having a "flexible by default" mindset makes it easy to craft and test out metaprogramming structures as you build them up.
