# Intended Audience

We built this documentation with application developers in mind. We want to explain how to use Joy for common use-cases. To that end, we strive to meet people where they are in their journey, both in developing a functional programming style and in software development more broadly. You will see links out to some fundamental programming concepts, and we're working on building a body of reference materials, just like this page.
